Hello!

My name is Shreerag Krishnakumar Marar and I'm from Pune, India. I'm an enthusiastic software developer, a continuous learner and a good problem solver. I love to do ethical hacking during my free time. I always carry a passion to do good projects that were never done before which made me a good problem solver. Keeping my academic and professional background aside, I love to go on bike rides and explore places. I also like trekking.

Foodies

On Tuesday's MCDA orientation. After I had the dinner, Neelam told me that I can carry any food along with me if required, I went and grabbed the deserts and I found Rashad and Hema doing the same. They grabbed Fried Rice and Butter Chicken. 
Hema told she was not allowed to cook non veg in her apartment hence,  she grabbed butter chicken. Rashad said he doesn't need to cook for 5 days now. I was like I'm sorted with this desert for 5 days.

	1- Hema
	Hema is from Chennai, India. She told she is a traveller and had travelled a lot of places in India and now she wants to explore a foreign country. She also wanted to pursue higher studies so she decided to move to Canada to pursue MCDA.
	2- Rashad Ahmed
	Rashad is also from Chennai and wanted to settle abroad and he chose Canada as his destination as he feels it is very good place, with great people. He also wished to switch his career and wants to become a Data Engineer hence, he decided to enroll to MCDA.

Interests- They love eating just like me and always ready to grab free food.

Fun fact about myself- If I could eat only one type of food for the rest of my life then I have an answer to that and it will be 'vada paav'.
